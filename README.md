# Dendrite 🧠

**Universal AI orchestration platform that automatically designs, tests, and deploys context-aware automation workflows.**

Dendrite transforms natural language task descriptions into intelligent, memory-informed automation systems. Instead of rigid agent chains or shallow RAG, it dynamically orchestrates optimal database topologies, retrieval strategies, and model configurations tailored to your specific domain and context.

## 🎯 The Problem

Current AI automation platforms are fundamentally limited:

- **Rigid architectures**: Hardcoded workflows that break on edge cases and can't adapt to domain-specific needs
- **Context blindness**: No persistent memory of user preferences, domain expertise, or historical patterns  
- **Shallow integration**: Tools that work in isolation without understanding broader task context
- **Manual configuration**: Users forced to understand complex technical details instead of describing what they want
- **No quality assurance**: Workflows fail silently or produce garbage without intelligent feedback loops

## 🧩 The Architecture

### Dynamic Memory Orchestration

Dendrite doesn't use fixed database schemas - it **designs optimal knowledge topologies** for each domain:

- **Configurable database types**: Temporal, hierarchical, relational, conceptual - whatever fits your information structure
- **Dynamic edge definitions**: Custom consolidation processes between databases with configurable permissions
- **Intelligent traversal strategies**: Model-controlled navigation for complex reasoning, embedding-magnetism for information retrieval
- **Cross-database gravitational pull**: Multiple retrieval heads that magnetize toward each other for precise, multi-dimensional context

### Orchestration-First Design

**Orchestration Agent**: Stateless model that designs memory architectures and workflow configurations through abstract tool calls

**Testing Agent**: Validates workflow execution with complete observability - sees what each model was shown, what decisions it made, provides A2A (Agent-to-Agent) feedback for iterative improvement

### Intelligent Gap Detection and Document Consolidation

When the orchestrator designs workflows and testing reveals knowledge gaps, it automatically creates new database structures and prompts users for specific documentation. The system then deploys specialized consolidation agents that process uploaded documents into entity-driven node structures optimized for the use case.

This creates a feedback loop where workflow testing drives targeted knowledge acquisition, ensuring the system has exactly the contextual information needed for high-quality automation.

**Workflow Persistence**: Save and reuse tested configurations, building up libraries of domain-specific automation patterns

## 🔧 Technical Innovation

### Proximity-Weighted Multi-Head Retrieval

Multiple specialized retrieval heads traverse different databases simultaneously with embedding-based proximity decay calculations. Heads are pulled toward each other when they identify semantically related content across database boundaries, creating convergent retrieval that surfaces multi-dimensional context.

The system calculates proximity weights between heads and uses orchestrated consolidation processes to identify intersection points where different information types relate to the same underlying concepts. This eliminates the scattered results problem of traditional RAG by ensuring retrieval heads work cooperatively rather than in isolation.

### Dynamic Consolidation Streams

The existing consolidation architecture can create arbitrary interconnection patterns between databases. When the orchestrator designs a workflow, it generates streams of consolidation agents that tie databases together through configurable permission schemas - note-to-note references, node-to-note connections, or custom relationship types.

This allows for complex information flows where insights from one domain automatically inform related domains through intelligent cross-references, creating rich contextual networks that evolve with use.

### Containerized Testing Environment

The testing agent can mock entire workflow executions locally before touching real data:
- **Complete execution traces**: What each model saw, what decisions it made, what it wrote to memory
- **Failure analysis**: Precise identification of where workflows break and why
- **Iterative improvement**: A2A feedback loops that refine configurations until they work

## 🔧 Real-World Examples

### Scientific Research Workflow

**Initial Design**: Orchestrator creates three databases - `literature`, `methodology`, `experimental_data`

**Consolidation Stream**: 
- `literature` → consolidates to `methodology` (note-to-note references for theoretical foundations)
- `experimental_data` → consolidates to `methodology` (node-to-note connections for protocol validation) 
- `methodology` → consolidates to both `literature` and `experimental_data` (bidirectional context enrichment)

**Testing Reveals Gap**: Workflow model attempts to generate comparative analysis but lacks statistical frameworks

**Orchestrator Response**: Creates new `statistical_methods` database, prompts user for "statistical analysis protocols you use for experimental validation"

**Enhanced Consolidation**: Adds `statistical_methods` → `experimental_data` and `statistical_methods` → `methodology` consolidation agents

**Traversal Optimization**: Sets `methodology` to model-controlled traversal (requires complex reasoning), others to embedding-based with proximity decay

**Final Output**: Research summary with theoretical grounding, methodological rigor, statistical validation, and experimental evidence - orchestrator automatically selects and integrates PowerPoint MCP for presentation generation, matplotlib MCP for data visualizations, and citation management MCP for reference formatting

### Legal Case Management

**Initial Design**: `cases`, `precedents`, `client_communications` databases

**Consolidation Stream**:
- `cases` → `precedents` (temporal-to-hierarchical consolidation for case law connections)
- `client_communications` → `cases` (communication context tied to specific case developments)
- `precedents` → `cases` (legal foundation references for current matters)

**Testing Failure**: Workflow attempts to draft motion but lacks jurisdiction-specific procedural rules  

**Orchestrator Iteration**: Creates `procedural_requirements` database, requests "court rules and filing procedures for your jurisdiction"

**Permission Update**: Adds `procedural_requirements` → `cases` (node-to-note, read-only enforcement to prevent procedural modifications)

**MCP Integration**: Workflow accesses user's approved MCP library - Google Docs for motion drafting, calendar integration for deadline tracking, citation formatter for legal references, Microsoft Word automation for document generation

**Adaptive Refinement**: When motion generator reports "insufficient procedural detail," orchestrator automatically adds more granular consolidation from `procedural_requirements`, adjusts traversal depth limits, and integrates additional MCP connectors (court filing systems, legal research databases) from user's available library

## 🔄 User-Driven Testing and Refinement

Users submit their own test cases, which drives targeted knowledge acquisition and ensures workflows actually work for real scenarios:

1. **User** provides test case ("Generate motion to dismiss for summary judgment in contract dispute")
2. **Orchestrator** designs initial workflow configuration and prompts for foundational documentation
3. **Tester** validates against user's test case with a prototype workflow agent in a containerized environment, doing dummy tool calls, testing retrieval, and identifying specific failures
4. **Orchestrator** updates traversal algorithms, adds databases, modifies consolidation permissions, asks user for documentation/deeper context to be ingested into new databases
5. **User**  Provides documentation.
6. **Write Pass** Stream of models populate new databases
7. **System adapts** through intelligent MCP connector selection from user's library, additional consolidation streams, or user-prompted documentation
8. **Process repeats** until test case passes successfully

Once the initial config is complete, database writing/consolidating can continue in future conversations and reviews can be requested where the orchestrator can look at real-time failed cases and adjust the workflow accordingly.

This creates **user-validated automation** where workflows are proven against real-world scenarios before and after deployment, and the initial and future documentation gathering is driven by actual use cases rather than theoretical needs.

## 💡 The Solution: Infinitely Adaptable Automation

Dendrite solves the fundamental problem of AI automation - **rigid workflows that break on edge cases**. By giving the orchestrator the ability to:

- **Design arbitrary database topologies** for any domain
- **Create dynamic consolidation streams** between multiple databases with configurable permissions
- **Update traversal strategies** based on testing feedback (model-controlled vs embedding-based)
- **Access user-approved MCP connector libraries** for actual output generation and tool integration
- **Automatically select optimal MCP combinations** based on task requirements (PowerPoint + matplotlib for research presentations, Google Docs + citation tools for legal documents, Excel + visualization libraries for business reports)
- **Iterate through orchestrator-tester feedback loops** until workflows actually work

Users can describe any complex task in natural language, and the system will automatically design, test, and deploy the optimal workflow configuration. When workflows fail, they **self-improve** by requesting additional context, updating database schemas, or integrating new tools from the MCP ecosystem.

This creates **universal automation** where the bottleneck isn't technical complexity - it's simply having enough domain knowledge and the right tools available in your MCP library.

## 🔬 Why This Matters

As AI becomes personal and ubiquitous, the bottleneck isn't model capability - it's **context management**. Dendrite provides the memory architecture and orchestration intelligence to make truly personal, context-aware AI automation possible.

This is infrastructure-level innovation: the **compiler for human intentions** that transforms natural language task descriptions into optimal AI workflow configurations.
